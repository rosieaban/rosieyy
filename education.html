            <h1>Educational Journey</h1>
            <p> My Educational Journey from Elementary to College as of now has
                been filled with challenges and obstacles but it has shaped me 
                for  who I am today. Despite the difficulties I faced, I was determined 
                to overcome them and make a most out of my educational opportunies.
                Throughout My Educational Journey I encounter the moment of self-doubt. 
                There are times that I questioned my abilities and felt overwhelmed by workloads
                that  I have more what ifs in my mind, but I learned not to give up by seeking support
                from my family and mentors. Their guidance and encouragement helped me to regain my self 
                confidence and to continue moving forward.
